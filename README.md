# üåä Macroscopic Quantum-Like Wave Packets  
**Understanding Coherent Packets in Macroscopic Systems Using Scale Relativity Theory**

---

## üî¨ Scientific Motivation
Quantum mechanics is often associated with microscopic systems, but **macroscopic systems can exhibit quantum-like behaviors** if an appropriate **quantum potential** is externally applied. This project demonstrates how **coherent wave packets**‚Äînormally associated with quantum systems‚Äîcan be **engineered at macroscopic scales** using concepts from **Scale Relativity Theory (SRT)**.

Using **Nottale‚Äôs Scale Relativity formulation**, we explore how the **Schr√∂dinger equation naturally arises** from fractal space-time dynamics. This perspective allows us to **generalize quantum effects** to macroscopic systems, enabling **wave packet coherence** even in classical physics.

## üìú Hypothesis
> *Even in macroscopic classical systems, applying the correct quantum potential can lead to coherent, non-spreading wave packets, mimicking quantum behavior.*

This project investigates the **stability conditions for quantum-like coherence**:
1. **Wave packets normally spread** due to dispersion.
2. **Applying a quantum potential** prevents dispersion, maintaining coherence.
3. **This demonstrates that macroscopic quantum-like behavior is possible** without invoking wave function collapse or entanglement.

### üî¨ Connection to Scale Relativity
- In **Scale Relativity Theory (SRT)**, space-time is **fractal at small scales**, leading to a natural **Schr√∂dinger-like equation**.
- This suggests that **quantum mechanics is a generalized description of wave dynamics**, not limited to microscopic particles.
- By **constructing a quantum potential** at **macroscopic scales**, we can **stabilize wave packets**, effectively extending **quantum-like effects** to classical systems.

```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£  Run a Coherent Wave Packet Simulation
```bash
python macroscopic_quantum_wave/scripts/run_simulation.py --num_steps 100 --dt 0.01 --omega 1.0
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£  Visualize the Wave Packet in Real Time
```bash

```

### üìà Expected Results
- Without a quantum potential, the wave packet spreads over time.
- With the correct quantum potential, the wave packet remains stable and oscillates coherently.
- This demonstrates that coherence can be engineered in macroscopic systems.
